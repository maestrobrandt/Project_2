## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- Create a separate notebook or file for scraping and another for cleaning your data. For future projects try creating functions. These functions can then be 
  placed in py files. Then you can call the function from your jupyter notebook. 

## Good Documentation:

- In your README.md, provide a clear scope and analysis, methodology, data science methods used, and summary of your findings.
- Markdown cell at beginning of .ipynb explains scope and analyis
- Inline code comments were used, but include them where help and necessary. For instance, comment/describe the "next gen feature" 


## Proper Data Science:

- Code demonstrates good Linear Regression understanding. Great thought process to try modeling with regularization.
- Consider log transforming your target
- Good visualizations -- not too much info, clear and interpretable. Love the busiest stations highlighted in orange on gray, very effective way to highlight relevant info.

## Comments:

- Good job on project 2! :)
- Love the approach/project design. Very clear and concise
- Nice visualizations and analysis
- Be sure to include a "results" section in your README in the future.
